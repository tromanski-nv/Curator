    Notes
    -----
    Architecture and Processing Flow:

    This implementation follows a clean separation of responsibilities with distinct methods
    for each part of the pipeline:

    Input Phase:
    - `read_minhash`: Reads minhash files and returns a DataFrame

    Processing Phase:
    - `minhash_to_bands`: Transforms a single minhash DataFrame into LSH bands
    - `read_and_insert`: Orchestrates reading, band creation, and insertion

    Output Phase:
    - `extract_and_group`: Extracts and groups shuffled data, yielding results as a generator
    - `extract_and_write`: Processes each yielded result and writes to output files immediately

    1. Files are read using `read_minhash`
    2. Data is processed with `minhash_to_bands` to extract LSH bucket IDs
    3. Processed data is immediately inserted into the shuffler
    4. Results are extracted and processed one partition at a time using generators
    5. Each partition is written to disk as soon as it's processed, without accumulating in memory
