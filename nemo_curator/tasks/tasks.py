class Task(ABC, Generic[T]):
    """Abstract base class for tasks in the pipeline.

    A task represents a batch of data to be processed. Different modalities
    (text, audio, video) can implement their own task types.

    Attributes:
        dataset_name: Name of the dataset this task belongs to.
        data: The task's payload (modality-specific).
        _stage_perf: Per-stage perf stats this task has accumulated.
        _metadata: Free-form metadata carried alongside the task.
        task_id: Deterministic identifier for this task. NOT user-settable —
            the framework assigns it via ``_set_task_id`` at every stage
            boundary. It is an underscore-joined id path through the pipeline
            DAG — the parents' ids plus this task's own segment (e.g.
            ``"abc123_0_5"`` = source ``abc123``, then child 0, then
            grandchild 5). Using the readable path directly (rather than a
            hash of it) keeps task ids easy to debug. Empty string until the
            first stage runs; two runs of the same pipeline on the same
            inputs produce byte-identical ``task_id``s across all tasks.

            A ``task_id`` that starts with ``"r"`` (followed by a uuid) is a
            fallback assigned when the parent→child mapping could NOT be
            derived — e.g. a stage that overrides ``process_batch`` with an
            ambiguous batch fan-out (M inputs → K≠M outputs). Such ids are
            NON-deterministic (differ across runs).
        _source_id: Source (input partition) this task descends from. Stamped at
            the source stage, inherited downstream; used only by the opt-in
            resumability layer. Empty for pre-source tasks.

        The ``task_id`` is the parent id and this task's own segment joined
        by ``"_"`` — e.g. parent ``"abc123"`` + suffix ``0`` →
        ``"abc123_0"``. Always overwrites ``task_id``; there is no
        idempotency check — each stage transition re-derives it, so the
        same physical Python object passing through N stages gets N
        distinct ``task_id``s (one per stage boundary). The dedup keys
        used by resumability are captured BEFORE this method runs on a
        given output, so the rewrite is safe.

        Only a single parent id is taken: the supported mappings (1→1,
        1→N fan-out, N→N positional) each give an output exactly one
        parent. N→1 aggregations don't track ancestry — those outputs get
        a random ``"r"``-prefixed id in the adapter instead of calling this.

            parent_task_id: ``task_id`` of the parent. An empty string
                (an unassigned / EmptyTask parent) is dropped so it doesn't
                contribute a leading ``"_"`` to the path.

                path — appended after the parent id. Either a positional
                index (``int`` → coerced to ``str``) for plain emissions,
                or a string id (e.g. a content-based hash from
