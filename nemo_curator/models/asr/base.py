"""Stage-adapter contract for audio speech-recognition.

``ASRStage`` owns Curator-side glue (``task.data`` reads, batching, ISO
language mapping, ``_skipme``), while ``ASRAdapter`` owns the model-side call
(weight download, model loading, generation, and packing into ``ASRResult``).
The split lets the stage swap models via a single YAML ``adapter_target:`` line.

class ASRResult:
    """Canonical per-utterance ASR adapter output.

    Identical across every adapter so the stage's schema-mutation path stays
    constant when the adapter is swapped.

    Attributes:
        text: Transcription text. Empty if skipped.
        skipped: True when the item could not be processed. The stage writes
            ``skip_reason`` to ``_skipme`` and falls back to ``"empty_audio"``
            when no reason is supplied.
        skip_reason: Optional machine-readable reason written to ``_skipme``
            when ``skipped`` is true. Defaults to ``"empty_audio"`` in the stage.
        unsupported_language: Optional normalized language code used by the
            stage to annotate items excluded by its language allowlist.
        extras: Adapter-specific, manifest-serializable diagnostics. When the
            stage's ``extras_key`` is enabled, it writes a shallow copy of this
            dictionary under that one nested output field without interpreting
            individual keys.

    Per-batch contract: ``transcribe_batch`` receives a list of per-task dicts
    (unpacked from ``task.data``) and returns one ``ASRResult`` per input, in
    order. Expected per-item keys (stage-populated):

    * ``waveform``: contiguous, mono, 1-D float32 NumPy samples normalized by
      ``ASRStage`` from a file or a reader-provided in-memory waveform.
    * ``sample_rate`` (``int``): the stage's configured target sample rate.
    * ``language`` (``str | None``): human-readable name (e.g. ``"English"``).
    * ``language_code`` (``str | None``): original language code from the
      configured stage input column.
    * ``task_id`` (``str | None``): carried through for diagnostics.
